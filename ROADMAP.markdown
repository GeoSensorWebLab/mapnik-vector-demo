# Roadmap

I would like to add other guides/demos for different projections that showcase how those projections are advantageous over Web Mercator. Here are some ideas:

* Antarctic Projection (EPSG:3031)
* USA Lambert Conformal Conic (ESRI:102004)
* UTM Chile (EPSG:5361)
* UTM New Zealand (EPSG:2193)
* 3D demo using EPSG:4326 and data from above demos
