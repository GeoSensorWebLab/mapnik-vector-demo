# Mapnik Vector Tiles with Custom Projections

This repository contains a guide and configuration files to set up a Vagrant Virtual Machine with a partial OpenStreetMap database, a raster and vector tile server, and a web map client.

The first part of the tutorial is `tutorial-1-3573.markdown` and covers setting up tiles for Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area Canada Projection EPSG:3573 and OSM data for Nunavut, Canada.
