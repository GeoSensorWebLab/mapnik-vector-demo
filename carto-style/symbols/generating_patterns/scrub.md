For the pattern for scrub type visit [jsdotpattern (command sequence is recorded)](http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,512,jdp97762;g5,45,64,64;rx,250,2,64,64;rx,250,2,64,64;rx,250,2,64,64;rd,1,0,0,scrub2,1,5,12,0,jdp3379,8ece8f,b5e3b5;)

The result is this following [pattern](http://www.imagico.de/map/jsdotpattern.php#x,256,jdp34863;g5,43,64,64;rd,1,0,0,scrub2,1,0,0,0,jdp48772,8ece8f,b5e3b5;).

Generated SVG image is sanitized for use with Mapnik by the script svg_pattern.sh from the jsdotpattern repository at http://github.com/imagico/jsdotpattern.

The final file is scrub.svg

Because of a [problem in the rendering stack](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/issues/2750) we donâ€™t use the SVG directly, but convert it to PNG.
