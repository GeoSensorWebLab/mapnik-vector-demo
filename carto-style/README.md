# OpenStreetMap Carto Style

This is a modified fork of the [openstreetmap-carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto) stylesheet.

Things removed for the mapnik-vector tutorial:

* scripts, because this style does not need update scripts
* CARTOGRAPHY.md, not needed
* CHANGELOD.md, not needed
* CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, see tutorial instead
* CONTRIBUTING.md, not needed
* Docker setup files, not needed
* indexes.sql/indexes.yml, as it is covered in the tutorial
* INSTALL.md, see tutorial instead
* openstreetmap-carto.lua, not needed
* preview.png, not needed
* RELEASES.md, not needed
* road-colors.yaml, not needed (no scripts)
* travis files, not needed
